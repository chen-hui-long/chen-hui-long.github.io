print("Hello World, Welcome") # Because Hello World is too basic
>> Hello World, Welcome
```

Hello World, welcome to my personal website. 

My name is Hui Long. Thank you for visiting my humble page, hopefully you will find it interesting. Opinions are my own and not the views of anyone else. 

First of all, I would like to give special thanks to [monkeyWzr](https://github.com/monkeyWzr) and [probberechts](https://github.com/probberechts) for this amazing Hugo theme, it makes my life alot easier as I hate CSS. 

**Purpose of this website**

One of my resolutions for the year 2024 is to increase my documentation of personal experiences. Although this post is being written in February, it's never too late to start, wouldn't you agree? Futhermore, today is actually the first day of the Lunar New Year.

I will be using this website to write and document on all sorts of things I find interesting. From small interesting life events (e.g. Discovery of an amazing plate of Char Kway Teow) to topics like programming, finance or trading related. 

**Why Hugo**

Since this is the first post of the website, let me talk about why I choose to use Hugo instead of other framework or site hosting website like [Medium](https://medium.com/). 

This page is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and deployed via Github. Previously, my personal website was built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), but I have decided to migrate everything to Hugo instead. 

Main reason will be speed. Hugo is **blazing fast**. This aspect alone makes it super useful when writing a post and rendering it. 

Although Hugo and Jekyll are written in different languages, the workflow for writing, styling and publishing a post are similar. Any user should be fine migrating between Hugo and Jekyll.

I never have any experience with Medium personally before. But I am the type of person the prefers to have full control of my own web page and the source code. This website will also showcase any projects I worked on (If time permits), not just a blog-focused website. 

This marks the end of my first post. While my writing may not rival Shakespeare's, I hope it will evolve and improve over time.
